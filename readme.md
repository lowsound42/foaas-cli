# Fuck Off As A Service - Terminal Tool
FOAAS is a beacon of hope in the increasingly sterile big-tech dominated internet. I wanted to build a command line tool for fun and to learn and though that an API wrapper for FOAAS would be fun to mess around with. So enjoy :)



## Installation

```
npm install -g foaas-cli

```

## Usage

You call the service by using the keywords foaas-cli and follow that up with the appropriate parameters. https://www.foaas.com for a list of what the service supports.
