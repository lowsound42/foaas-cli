# Fuck Off As A Service - Terminal Tool
FOAAS is a beacon of hope in the increasingly sterile big-tech dominated internet (https://www.foaas.com for the uninitiated). I wanted to build a command line tool for fun and to learn and thought that an API wrapper for FOAAS would be fun to mess around with. So enjoy :)



## Installation

```
npm install -g foaas-cli
```

## Usage

You call the service by using the keywords **foaas-cli** in your terminal and follow that up with the appropriate parameters. 

For example, the command **foaas-cli me Omar** will return the following response:

```
Fuck me.
- Omar
```

It ain't rocket science but it's fun and funny.
