# Fuck Off As A Service - Terminal Tool
FOAAS is a beacon of hope in the increasingly sterile 'Big Tech' dominated internet (https://www.foaas.com for the uninitiated). I wanted to build a command line tool for fun as well as to learn, and I thought that an API wrapper for FOAAS would be fun to mess around with. So enjoy :)

## Installation

```
npm install -g foaas-cli
```

## Usage

You call the service by using the keywords ```foaas-cli``` in your terminal and follow that up with the appropriate parameters. 

For example, the command ```foaas-cli me Omar``` will return the following response:

```
Fuck me.
- Omar
```

It ain't rocket science but it's fun and funny.

https://www.foaas.com for a list of what the service supports. I'll add a comprehensive list here eventually but here's a few to get you started:

```foaas-cli what :from``` gives you **What the fuck?! -:from**
```foaas-cli that :from``` gives you **Fuck that. -:from**
```foaas-cli maybe :from``` gives you **Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. -:from**

There are tons more so do check out the website and feel free to experiment.
